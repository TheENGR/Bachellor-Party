## Magic Details
### Cantrips

#### Toll the Dead
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage.

The spell's damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d8 or 2d12), 11th level (3d8 or 3d12), and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12).
#### Mage Hand
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.
#### Mind Sliver
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. 
The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage and subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.
#### Fire Bolt
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.
### 1st Level
#### Shield
___
- **Casting Time:** [Reaction](./../README.md#reaction), which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic missile.
#### Mage Armor
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** 8 hours
---
You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target's base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.
#### Witch Bolt
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** [Concentration](./../README.md#concentration), up to 1 minute
---
A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has total cover from you.
#### Tasha's Caustic Brew
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** Self (30-foot line)
- **Duration:** [Concentration](./../README.md#concentration), up to 1 minute
---
A stream of acid emanates from you in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be covered in acid for the spell's duration or until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off itself or another creature. A creature covered in the acid takes 2d4 acid damage at start of each of its turns.
### 2nd Level

#### Misty Step
___

- **Duration:** [Concentration](./../README.md#concentration), up to 1 minute
---
You fill the air with spinning daggers in a cube 5 feet on each side, centered on a point you choose within range. A creature takes 4d4 slashing damage when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there.
#### Ray of Enfeeblement
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** [Concentration](./../README.md#concentration), up to 1 minute
---
A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength until the spell ends.

At the end of each of the target's turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.
### 3rd Level
#### Counterspell
___
- **Casting Time:** [Reaction](./../README.md#reaction), which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.
#### Fireball
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
#### Hypnotic Pattern
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** [Concentration](./../README.md#concentration), up to 1 minute
---
You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
#### Lightning Bolt
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** Self (100-foot line)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
### 4th Level
#### Polymorph
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** [Concentration](./../README.md#concentration), up to 1 hour
---
This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on an unwilling shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
