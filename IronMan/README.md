## Magic Details
### Cantrips
#### Mending
*Transmutation cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.
#### Shocking Grasp
*Evocation cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
#### Thunderclap
