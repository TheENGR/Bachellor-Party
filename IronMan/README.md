## Magic Details
### Cantrips
#### Mending
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.

#### Shocking Grasp
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 lightning damage, and it can't take [Reactions](./../README.md#reaction) until the start of its next turn.

#### Thunderclap
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
You create a burst of thunderous sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away. Each creature within range, other than you, must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 thunder damage.

### 1st Level
#### Faerie Fire
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** [Concentration](./../README.md#concentration), up to 1 minute
Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

#### Identify
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.

#### Detect Magic
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** [Concentration](./../README.md#concentration), up to 10 minutes
For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

#### Feather Fall
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 [Reaction](./../README.md#reaction), which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** 1 minute
Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.

#### Magic Missile
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

#### Thunderwave
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** Self (15-foot cube)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

### 2nd Level
#### Arcane Lock
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Until dispelled
You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting *knock* on the object suppresses *arcane lock* for 10 minutes.

While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.

#### Enlarge or Reduce
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** [Concentration](./../README.md#concentration), up to 1 minute
You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.

If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.

***Enlarge.*** The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one categoryâ€”from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.

***Reduce.*** The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one categoryâ€”from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).

#### Invisibility
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** [Concentration](./../README.md#concentration), up to 1 hour
A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

#### See Invisibility
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 hour
For the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.

#### Mirror Image
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 minute
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

#### Shatter
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.
