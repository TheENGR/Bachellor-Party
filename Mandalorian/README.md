## Magic Details
### Cantrips
#### Fire Bolt
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

### 1st Level
#### Magic Missile
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.
#### Witch Bolt
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** [Concentration](./../README.md#concentration), up to 1 minute
---
A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has total cover from you.
#### Burning Hands
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** Self (15-foot cone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
### 2nd Level
#### Dragon's Breath
___
- **Casting Time:** [Bonus Action](./../README.md#bonus-action)
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** [Concentration](./../README.md#concentration), up to 1 minute
---
You touch one willing creature and imbue it with the power to spew magical energy from its mouth, provided it has one. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Until the spell ends, the creature can use an action to exhale energy of the chosen type in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
#### Levitate
___
- **Casting Time:** [Action](./../README.md#action)
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** [Concentration](./../README.md#concentration), up to 10 minutes
---
One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.
