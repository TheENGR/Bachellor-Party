## How does the game work? 
### Not Combat
You say what you want to do, like open a door or try to disarmn a trap, and then the DM tells you if you have to roll a die (d20) to see if it works. You roll the die and add the skill bonus that the DM says and the results tells everyone if it worked or not. 

Try to react to everything in character!
### Combat
Combat starts when the DM asks for initative or when the players try to kill/attack a living thing.
#### Initative
At the start of combat the DM asks you to roll "initative" which is a d20 + your initiative bonus. This determines who gets to go first and who has to go last
#### Your Turn
You can do 3 things on your turn
1) Action
    - Cast a spell
    - Use an ability
    - Attack
        - Swing a sword
        - Punch someone
        - Fire a gun
    - Run Farther
    - Flee (Disengage)
        - People cannot hit you when you run away
    - Dodge
    - Hide
2) Bonus Action
    - These are listed on your character sheet
        - EX: Hulk can punch, or Indiana Jones can Disengage
4) Move
    - You can walk/run around the battlefield 

You also get your [reaction](#reaction) back to use on someone elses turn

#### Reaction
Reactions are used to do things after someone else does something.

Examples:
1) I wait to punch them until Albus casts a spell
2) I stab them as they run away
3) I cast Shield to protect myself!
